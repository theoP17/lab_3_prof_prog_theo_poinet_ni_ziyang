############################ genetic_part1 ############################

--> Mastermind Genetic Algorithm
This part utilizes a genetic algorithm to solve the classic Mastermind game. The algorithm includes selection, crossover, and mutation steps.

*********** Usage ***********
Run the script solve_mastermind_NI_ZIYANG_THEO_POINET.py

*********** How it Works ***********
The algorithm generates guesses using a genetic algorithm, evaluates each guess, selects the fittest ones for reproduction, and repeats this process until a correct guess is found.

*********** Algorithm Details ***********
- Initialize the population
- Sort the population based on fitness
- Remove a certain proportion of individuals
- Reproduce new individuals
- Mutate new individuals
- Repeat until a stopping condition is met

*********** Configuration ***********
Customize the genetic algorithm by adjusting parameters in the GASolver constructor.

############################ genetic_part2 ############################

--> Travelling Salesperson Problem Solver (TSP)
This part implements a genetic algorithm to solve the Travelling Salesperson Problem (TSP). The algorithm involves selection, crossover, and mutation.

*********** Usage ***********
Run the script solve_tsp_NI_ZIYANG_THEO_POINET.py

*********** How it Works ***********
The algorithm generates city sequences using a genetic algorithm, evaluates each sequence, selects the fittest ones for reproduction, and repeats this process until the best route is found.

*********** Algorithm Details ***********
- Initialize the population
- Sort the population based on fitness
- Remove a certain proportion of individuals
- Reproduce new individuals
- Mutate new individuals
- Repeat until a stopping condition is met

*********** Configuration ***********
Customize the genetic algorithm by adjusting parameters in the GASolver constructor.

############################ genetic_part3 ############################

--> ga_solver
This part provides a general genetic algorithm implementation to solve defined problems. Define a problem using the GAProblem class and implement four methods. Then, use the GASolver class to solve the problem.

--> Mastermind_problem & tsp_problem
Given Mastermind and TSP problems are solved using the general implementation.
